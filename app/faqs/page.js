          <p>There could be several reasons why no colleges are shown as eligible for a particular rank:</p>

            <li><span className="font-medium">High Rank:</span> Your rank might not be in the range of previous year OR-CR range, so no college is filtered. Try approximating your rank by +/- 100 ranks for better results.</li>
           <li>
  <span className="font-medium">Data Limitations:</span> The predictions are based on previous year&apos;s cutoff data (JoSAA 2024, 5th round). Please note that cutoffs can vary each year due to factors such as exam difficulty, number of applicants, and seat availability.

            <li><span className="font-medium">Filters:</span> Selected filters may limit the result set. Adjust filters to broaden the results.</li>
